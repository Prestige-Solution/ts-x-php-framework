### Important Configuration
***Set Permission Change (Modify) Power and Delete Power to 75. Otherwise, the tests with permissions will be fail.**

### Important Notes
If you run this Live Server Tests the Clients see massive Server Log entrys with Anti-Flood errors.<br>
The test are very quickly with a lot of connections from the bot (one connection and disconnection for each test).<br>
The Serveradministrator has no Anti-Flood Permissions, so maybe you as Administrator cant see this entrys.

## Setup your Bot Identity
### Setup Query / Bot Servergroup
Create a new server group with the name psbot, bot or a name of your choice.<br>
You find a set of rights (150) at [query_user_servergroup_export](query_user_servergroup_export.csv) that the bot needs for secure operation.<br>
The easiest way to set these settings is with [YaTQA](https://yat.qa/) as serveradmin.

#### Import CSV with YaTQA
Navigate with YaTQA to Servergroups **(1)**. Choose your created Servergroup for the query bot **(2)**. Right Click on Global and Click at Import Permissions **(3)**.
Select and Import the CSV.<br>

---

#### Create a new Bot Identity
Start the Teamspeak client and create a new identity. You can create this via Extras **(1)** - Identities **(2)**. To do this, click on Create and enter a name as the identity name **(3)** and nickname **(4)**. Then confirm with OK. Now connect to your server **with this identity**. You can tell whether the identity is being used by the bold font.<br>
![setup_bot-identitaet_1](img/setup_bot-identitaet_1.png)

Now assign the bot server group to the bot identity. The bot identity is now in the bot server group. Connect with the bot identity to your Server and create a new Query Login. The name you have to enter is your query login name. The password is generated automatically.<br>
**IMPORTANT: SAVE THE LOGIN NAME AND PASSWORD**<br><br>
Leave the server and change your identity back to the one you used previously. The bot identity is no longer needed. Your server now knows this identity.<br>
**NOTE:** If you lost your Identity? No Problem! Create a new one by repeat the previously steps. Delete the older Identity form your Server (by using YaTQA at User DB entrys)
